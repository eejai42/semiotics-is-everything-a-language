-- CUSTOMIZE VIEWS - User-defined views and view extensions
-- ============================================================================
-- This file is for YOUR custom views that should persist across
-- regeneration of the base ERB files.
--
-- USE THIS FILE FOR:
--   - Additional views not defined in the rulebook
--   - Specialized views for reporting or dashboards
--   - Views that combine data from multiple base views
--   - Materialized views for performance optimization
--
-- IMPORTANT:
--   - This file runs AFTER 03-create-views.sql
--   - All base vw_* views already exist when this runs
--   - This file will NOT be overwritten by ERB regeneration
--   - If you need to EXTEND a base view, create a new view that selects from it
--
-- ERB VIEW PATTERN:
--   - Base views (vw_*) contain all denormalized data + calculated fields
--   - READ from views, WRITE to base tables
--   - Never JOIN in application code - extend views instead
--
-- EXAMPLES:
--
--   -- Custom reporting view
--   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_summary AS
--   SELECT
--       DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS month,
--       COUNT(*) AS record_count,
--       SUM(amount) AS total_amount
--   FROM vw_orders
--   GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at);
--
--   -- Extended view with additional computed fields
--   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_orders_extended AS
--   SELECT
--       o.*,
--       calc_orders_total_with_tax(o.order_id) AS total_with_tax
--   FROM vw_orders o;
--
--   -- Materialized view for heavy queries
--   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS mv_dashboard_stats AS
--   SELECT ... FROM vw_orders ...;
--
-- ============================================================================

-- Your custom views go here:

-- Override vw_people to use calculated list fields instead of empty base table columns
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_people WITH (security_invoker = ON) AS
SELECT
  t.person_id,
  t.name,
  t.wikidata_id,
  t.birth_date,
  t.is_historical,
  calc_people_offices_held_list(t.person_id) AS offices_held_list,
  calc_people_residences_list(t.person_id) AS residences_list,
  calc_people_has_ever_been_us_senator(t.person_id) AS has_ever_been_us_senator,
  calc_people_senator_term_count(t.person_id) AS senator_term_count
FROM people t;
