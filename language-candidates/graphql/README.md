# Graphql Language Candidate

GraphQL schema generation from the Effortless Rulebook.

Future implementation will generate GraphQL types, queries, mutations, and resolvers.

## Technology

**GraphQL** is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook (2012, open-sourced 2015). Unlike REST's fixed endpoints, GraphQL lets clients request exactly the fields they need in a single query, with strong typing enforced by a schema.

Key characteristics:
- **Schema-first**: Types, queries, and mutations are defined in SDL (Schema Definition Language)
- **Hierarchical queries**: Clients can traverse relationships in a single request
- **Strong typing**: Every field has a type; the schema serves as a contract and documentation
- **Introspection**: Clients can query the schema itself to discover available types and fields

ERB GraphQL exports would generate:
```graphql
type LanguageCandidate {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  hasSyntax: Boolean
  requiresParsing: Boolean
  meaningIsSerialized: Boolean
  isOngologyDescriptor: Boolean
  topFamilyFeudAnswer: Boolean  # Calculated
  category: String
}

type Query {
  languageCandidates: [LanguageCandidate!]!
  languageCandidate(id: ID!): LanguageCandidate
  argumentSteps: [ArgumentStep!]!
}
```

## Status

This is a placeholder generated by the ERB orchestration system.
