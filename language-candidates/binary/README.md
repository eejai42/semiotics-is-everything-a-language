# Binary Language Candidate

Binary format generation from the Effortless Rulebook.

Future implementation will generate compact binary serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, MessagePack).

## Technology

**Binary serialization** represents data as compact byte sequences rather than human-readable text. Unlike JSON or XML, binary formats encode type information and values directly as bytes, eliminating parsing overhead and reducing payload size by 2-10x.

Key characteristics:
- **Schema-driven**: Formats like Protocol Buffers and Thrift require schema definitions (`.proto`, `.thrift` files) that compile to code
- **Self-describing vs. Schema-required**: MessagePack and CBOR include type markers inline; Protobuf requires the schema to decode
- **Backward compatibility**: Well-designed schemas support field addition/removal without breaking existing readers

Common formats for ERB export:
- **Protocol Buffers** - Google's format, excellent tooling, strict schemas
- **MessagePack** - "JSON in binary", schema-optional, widely supported
- **CBOR** - IETF standard (RFC 8949), optimized for constrained environments

## Status

This is a placeholder generated by the ERB orchestration system.
