# Csv Language Candidate

CSV file generation from the Effortless Rulebook.

Future implementation will generate tabular CSV exports of entities, relationships, and metadata.

## Technology

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** is a plain-text tabular format defined by RFC 4180. Each line represents a record, with fields separated by commas. Despite its simplicity, CSV remains the universal interchange format for spreadsheets, databases, and data analysis tools.

Key characteristics:
- **Universal compatibility**: Excel, Google Sheets, pandas, R, SQL imports all support CSV natively
- **Human-readable**: Can be opened in any text editor for inspection
- **Flat structure**: Best for denormalized, single-table exports; relationships require multiple files or embedded IDs
- **No type information**: All values are strings; consumers must infer or specify types

ERB CSV exports would produce:
- `language_candidates.csv` - One row per candidate with all predicate columns
- `is_everything_a_language.csv` - One row per argument step with formalization and evidence

## Status

This is a placeholder generated by the ERB orchestration system.
