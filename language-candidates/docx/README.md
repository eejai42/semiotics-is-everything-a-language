# Docx Language Candidate

DOCX document generation from the Effortless Rulebook.

Future implementation will generate Microsoft Word documents with formatted specifications and documentation.

## Technology

**DOCX (Office Open XML)** is Microsoft Word's native format since 2007, standardized as ECMA-376 and ISO/IEC 29500. A `.docx` file is actually a ZIP archive containing XML files for content, styles, relationships, and embedded media.

Key characteristics:
- **Rich formatting**: Headings, tables, lists, fonts, colors, images, and page layout
- **Structured content**: XML-based, enabling programmatic generation via libraries like python-docx, docx4j, or pandoc
- **Track changes & comments**: Supports collaborative review workflows
- **Cross-platform**: Opens in Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, and most document editors

ERB DOCX exports would generate:
- Formatted specification documents with the logical argument structure
- Tables showing language candidates with their predicate evaluations
- Glossary sections explaining the operational definition of "language"
- Visual highlighting of witnesses, counterexamples, and fuzzy boundary cases
