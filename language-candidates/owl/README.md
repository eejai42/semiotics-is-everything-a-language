# Owl Language Candidate

OWL (Web Ontology Language) generation from the Effortless Rulebook.

Future implementation will generate OWL ontologies for semantic web applications and knowledge graphs.

## Technology

**OWL (Web Ontology Language)** is a W3C standard for defining ontologies—formal specifications of concepts, relationships, and constraints within a domain. Built on RDF and Description Logic, OWL enables automated reasoning about class membership and relationship inference.

Key characteristics:
- **Description Logic foundation**: OWL DL provides decidable reasoning with expressive power
- **Class hierarchies**: Define `Language` as a subclass of `Concept` with necessary/sufficient conditions
- **Property restrictions**: Express constraints like "every Language must have exactly one value for hasSyntax"
- **Reasoning support**: Tools like Pellet, HermiT, and FaCT++ can infer implied facts

ERB OWL exports would define:
```turtle
:Language rdf:type owl:Class ;
    owl:equivalentClass [
        rdf:type owl:Class ;
        owl:intersectionOf (
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :hasSyntax ; owl:hasValue true ]
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :requiresParsing ; owl:hasValue true ]
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :meaningIsSerialized ; owl:hasValue true ]
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :isOntologyDescriptor ; owl:hasValue true ]
        )
    ] .
```

This allows a reasoner to automatically classify candidates as Language or non-Language based on their predicate values.
