# English Language Candidate

English prose documentation from the Effortless Rulebook.

Future implementation will generate human-readable specifications, glossaries, and documentation.

## Technology

**Natural Language Generation (NLG)** transforms structured data into human-readable prose. Unlike templated text, NLG aims to produce fluent, contextually appropriate sentences that read as if written by a human author.

Key characteristics:
- **Template-based**: Simple variable substitution ("The candidate {name} has HasSyntax={value}")
- **Rule-based**: Grammar rules and sentence patterns combined programmatically
- **LLM-assisted**: Modern approaches use language models to produce natural phrasing from structured inputs

ERB English exports would generate:
- **Argument narratives**: "To demonstrate that not everything is a language, consider the following: A Coffee Mug lacks syntax, does not require parsing, and does not serialize meaning..."
- **Candidate profiles**: Prose descriptions of each language candidate explaining why it does or doesn't qualify
- **Glossary entries**: Definitions of predicates like HasSyntax, RequiresParsing, MeaningIsSerialized
- **Executive summaries**: High-level overview of the thesis and supporting evidence

The goal is documentation that non-technical stakeholders can read without understanding formal logic notation.
