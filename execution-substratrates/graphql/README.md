# Graphql Language Candidate

GraphQL schema and resolvers generated from the Effortless Rulebook.

This substrate generates:
- `schema.graphql`: GraphQL type definitions for all entities
- `resolvers.js`: JavaScript resolver functions for calculated fields

The resolvers implement the exact same calculation logic as the PostgreSQL functions, enabling consistent results across all execution substrates.

## Technology

**GraphQL** is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook (2012, open-sourced 2015). Unlike REST's fixed endpoints, GraphQL lets clients request exactly the fields they need in a single query, with strong typing enforced by a schema.

Key characteristics:
- **Schema-first**: Types, queries, and mutations are defined in SDL (Schema Definition Language)
- **Hierarchical queries**: Clients can traverse relationships in a single request
- **Strong typing**: Every field has a type; the schema serves as a contract and documentation
- **Introspection**: Clients can query the schema itself to discover available types and fields

This ERB GraphQL substrate generates both the schema definitions and the JavaScript resolver functions needed to compute calculated fields.

## Status

This is a placeholder generated by the ERB orchestration system.
